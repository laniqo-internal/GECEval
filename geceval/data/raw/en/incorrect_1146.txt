Well here in Dublin things still the same, but I think somebody told you that I went to the moby concert here at the point wich is the big theatre for events and concerts, I guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard, well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage, so I went to help them and everithing else, and when I get into the point, do you who was there?
