Well here in Dublin things are still the same, but I think someone told you that I went to the MOBY concert here at the Point which is the big theatre for events and concerts, I guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard, well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage, so I went to help them and everything else, and when I got inside the Point, do you know who was there?
