Well, here in Dublin, things are still the same, but I think someone told you that I went to the Moby concert here at The Point, which is the big theater for events and concerts. I guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is... well, do you remember my friend Luke, the one who works as a security guard? Well, he told me that they needed people to set up the stage, so I went to help them out and everything else. And when I got to the venue, do you know who was there?
