Just imagine, it was Moby, so I went to say hello to him, and he told me if you could help me with my decks, so I went, and when we finished he gave me a T-shirt and a golden pass to see the concert from the front row, oh my God! That's the best thing that has ever happened to me. Well, Kim, I hope to receive a letter from you soon, and please tell everyone about the Moby concert and everything, thanks.
