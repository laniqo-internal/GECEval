However, some of us in this class saw an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show" that will take place at Central Exhibition Hall, London, on Tuesday March 14th from 10.00 am to 7.00 pm and at the same time we are supposed to visit the Science Museum. We would all love to attend the event.
