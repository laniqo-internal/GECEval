I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOUSE TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW VERY WELL THE AREA BECAUSE ALL TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF IN THE COURNER OF MY HOUSE. BUT THAT DAY, LIKE I WAS KIND OF DRUNK, I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT WAY; SO WHEN I NOTICED IT THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY ASKING ME TO GET OFF, BECAUSE WE WHERE IN THE GARAGE IN PORTOBELLO.
