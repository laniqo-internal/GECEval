I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOSE TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW VERY WELL THE AREA BECAUSE ALL THE TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF IN THE CORNER OF MY HOUSE. But that day, like I was kind of drunk, I didn't realize that the bus took a different way; so when I noticed it, the driver was already asking me to get off, because we were in the garage in Portobello.
