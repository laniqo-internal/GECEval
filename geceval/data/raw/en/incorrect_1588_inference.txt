I was living quite close to Portobello Road but didn't know very well the area because all time I just had to get off in the corner of my house. But that day, like I was kind of drunk, I didn't realize that the bus took a different way; so when I noticed it, the driver was already asking me to get off, because we were in the garage in Portobello.
